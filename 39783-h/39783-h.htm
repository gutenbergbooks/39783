DANTE, <i>De Vulgari Eloquio</i>, II. 10.</span>

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
I<br />
<br />
Ah! red-leafed time hath driven out the rose<br />
And crimson dew is fallen on the leaf<br />
Ere ever yet the cold white wheat be sown<br />
That hideth all earth's green and sere and red;<br />
The Moon-flower's fallen and the branch is bare,<br />
Holding no honey for the starry bees;<br />
The Maiden turns to her dark lord's demesne.<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
Fairer than Enna's field when Ceres sows<br />
The stars of hyacinth and puts off grief,<br />
Fairer than petals on May morning blown<br />
Through apple-orchards where the sun hath shed<br />
His brighter petals down to make them fair;<br />
Fairer than these the Poppy-crowned One flees,<br />
And Joy goes weeping in her scarlet train.<br />
<br />
III<br />
<br />
The faint damp wind that, ere the even, blows<br />
Piling the west with many a tawny sheaf,<br />
Then when the last glad wavering hours are mown<br />
Sigheth and dies because the day is sped;<br />
This wind is like her and the listless air<br />
Wherewith she goeth by beneath the trees,<br />
The trees that mock her with their scarlet stain.<br />
<br />
IV<br />
<br />
Love that is born of Time and comes and goes!<br />
Love that doth hold all noble hearts in fief!<br />
As red leaves follow where the wind hath flown,<br />
So all men follow Love when Love is dead.<br />
O Fate of Wind! O Wind that cannot spare,<br />
But drivest out the Maid, and pourest lees<br />
Of all thy crimson on the wold again,<br />
<br />
V<br />
<br />
Korè my heart is, let it stand sans gloze!<br />
Love's pain is long, and lo, love's joy is brief!<br />
My heart erst alway sweet is bitter grown;<br />
As crimson ruleth in the good green's stead,<br />
So grief hath taken all mine old joy's share<br />
And driven forth my solace and all ease<br />
Where pleasure bows to all-usurping pain.<br />
<br />
VI<br />
<br />
Crimson the hearth where one last ember glows!<br />
My heart's new winter hath no such relief,<br />
Nor thought of Spring whose blossom he hath known<br />
Hath turned him back where Spring is banished.<br />
Barren the heart and dead the fires there,<br />
Blow! O ye ashes, where the winds shall please,<br />
But cry, "Love also is the Yearly Slain."<br />
<br />
VII<br />
<br />
Be sped, my Canzon, through the bitter air!<br />
To him who speaketh words as fair as these,<br />
Say that I also know the "Yearly Slain."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="CANZON_THE_SPEAR" id="CANZON_THE_SPEAR"></a>CANZON: THE SPEAR<br />
<br />
<br />
I<br />
<br />
'Tis the clear light of love I praise<br />
That steadfast gloweth o'er deep waters,<br />
A clarity that gleams always.<br />
Though man's soul pass through troubled waters,<br />
Strange ways to him are openèd.<br />
To shore the beaten ship is sped<br />
If only love of light give aid.<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
That fair far spear of light now lays<br />
Its long gold shaft upon the waters.<br />
Ah! might I pass upon its rays<br />
To where it gleams beyond the waters,<br />
Or might my troubled heart be fed<br />
Upon the frail clear light there shed,<br />
Then were my pain at last allay'd.<br />
<br />
III<br />
<br />
Although the clouded storm dismays<br />
Many a heart upon these waters,<br />
The thought of that far golden blaze<br />
Giveth me heart upon the waters,<br />
Thinking thereof my bark is led<br />
To port wherein no storm I dread;<br />
No tempest maketh me afraid.<br />
<br />
IV<br />
<br />
Yet when within my heart I gaze<br />
Upon my fair beyond the waters,<br />
Meseems my soul within me prays<br />
To pass straightway beyond the waters.<br />
Though I be alway banished<br />
From ways and woods that she doth tread,<br />
One thing there is that doth not fade,<br />
<br />
V<br />
<br />
Deep in my heart that spear-print stays,<br />
That wound I gat beyond the waters,<br />
Deeper with passage of the days<br />
That pass as swift and bitter waters,<br />
While a dull fire within my head<br />
Moveth itself if word be said<br />
Which hath concern with that far maid.<br />
<br />
VI<br />
<br />
My love is lovelier than the sprays<br />
Of eglantine above clear waters,<br />
Or whitest lilies that upraise<br />
Their heads in midst of moated waters.<br />
No poppy in the May-glad mead<br />
Would match her quivering lips' red<br />
If 'gainst her lips it should be laid.<br />
<br />
VII<br />
<br />
The light within her eyes, which slays<br />
Base thoughts and stilleth troubled waters,<br />
Is like the gold where sunlight plays<br />
Upon the still o'ershadowed waters.<br />
When anger is there mingled<br />
There comes a keener gleam instead,<br />
Like flame that burns beneath thin jade.<br />
<br />
VIII<br />
<br />
Know by the words here mingled<br />
What love hath made my heart his stead,<br />
Glowing like flame beneath thin jade.<br />

TO BE SUNG BENEATH A WINDOW<br />
<br />
<br />
I<br />
<br />
Heart mine, art mine, whose embraces<br />
Clasp but wind that past thee bloweth<br />
E'en this air so subtly gloweth,<br />
Guerdoned by thy sun-gold traces,<br />
That my heart is half afraid<br />
For the fragrance on him laid;<br />
Even so love's might amazes!<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
Man's love follows many faces,<br />
My love only one face knoweth;<br />
Towards thee only my love floweth,<br />
And outstrips the swift stream's paces.<br />
Were this love well here displayed,<br />
As flame flameth 'neath thin jade<br />
Love should glow through these my phrases.<br />
<br />
III<br />
<br />
Though I've roamed through many places,<br />
None there is that my heart troweth<br />
Fair as that wherein fair groweth<br />
One whose laud here interlaces<br />
Tuneful words, that I've essayed.<br />
Let this tune be gently played<br />
Which my voice herward upraises.<br />
<br />
IV<br />
<br />
If my praise her grace effaces,<br />
Then 'tis not my heart that showeth,<br />
But the skilless tongue that soweth<br />
Words unworthy of her graces.<br />
Tongue, that hath me so betrayed,<br />
Were my heart but here displayed,<br />
Then were sung her fitting praises.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I<br />
<br />
Thy gracious ways,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">O Lady of my heart, have</span><br />
O'er all my thought their golden glamour cast;<br />
As amber torch-flames, where strange men-at-arms<br />
Tread softly 'neath the damask shield of night,<br />
Rise from the flowing steel in part reflected,<br />
So on my mailed thought that with thee goeth,<br />
Though dark the way, a golden glamour falleth.<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
The censer sways<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">And glowing coals some art have</span><br />
To free what frankincense before held fast<br />
Till all the summer of the eastern farms<br />
Doth dim the sense, and dream up through the light,<br />
As memory, by new-born love corrected&mdash;<br />
With savour such as only new love knoweth&mdash;<br />
Through swift dim ways the hidden pasts recalleth.<br />
<br />
III<br />
<br />
On barren days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">At hours when I, apart, have</span><br />
Bent low in thought of the great charm thou hast,<br />
Behold with music's many-stringed charms<br />
The silence groweth thou. O rare delight!<br />
The melody upon clear strings inflected<br />
Were dull when o'er taut sense thy presence floweth,<br />
With quivering notes' accord that never palleth.<br />
<br />
IV<br />
<br />
The glowing rays<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">That from the low sun dart, have</span><br />
Turned gold each tower and every towering mast;<br />
The saffron flame, that flaming nothing harms<br />
Hides Khadeeth's pearl and all the sapphire might<br />
Of burnished waves, before her gates collected:<br />
The cloak of graciousness, that round thee gloweth,<br />
Doth hide the thing thou art, as here befalleth.<br />
<br />
V<br />
<br />
All things worth praise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">That unto Khadeeth's mart have</span><br />
From far been brought through perils over-passed,<br />
All santal, myrrh, and spikenard that disarms<br />
The pard's swift anger; these would weigh but light<br />
'Gainst thy delights, my Khadeeth! Whence protected<br />
By naught save her great grace that in him showeth,<br />
My song goes forth and on her mercy calleth.<br />
<br />
VI<br />
<br />
O censer of the thought that golden gloweth,<br />
Be bright before her when the evening falleth.<br />
<br />
VII<br />
<br />
Fragrant be thou as a new field one moweth,<br />
O song of mine that "Hers" her mercy calleth.<br />

<br />
I<br />
<br />
He that is Lord of all the realms of light<br />
Hath unto me from His magnificence<br />
Granted such vision as hath wrought my joy.<br />
Moving my spirit past the last defence<br />
That shieldeth mortal things from mightier sight,<br />
Where freedom of the soul knows no alloy,<br />
I saw what forms the lordly powers employ;<br />
Three splendours, saw I, of high holiness,<br />
From clarity to clarity ascending<br />
Through all the roofless, tacit courts extending<br />
In aether which such subtle light doth bless<br />
As ne'er the candles of the stars hath wooed;<br />
Know ye herefrom of their similitude.<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
Withdrawn within the cavern of his wings,<br />
Grave with the joy of thoughts beneficent,<br />
And finely wrought and durable and clear,<br />
If so his eyes showed forth the mind's content,<br />
So sate the first to whom remembrance clings,<br />
Tissued like bat's wings did his wings appear,<br />
Not of that shadowy colouring and drear,<br />
But as thin shells, pale saffron, luminous;<br />
Alone, unlonely, whose calm glances shed<br />
Friend's love to strangers though no word were said,<br />
Pensive his godly state he keepeth thus.<br />
Not with his surfaces his power endeth,<br />
But is as flame that from the gem extendeth.<br />
<br />
III<br />
<br />
My second marvel stood not in such ease,<br />
But he, the cloudy pinioned, winged him on<br />
Then from my sight as now from memory,<br />
The courier aquiline, so swiftly gone!<br />
The third most glorious of these majesties<br />
Give aid, O sapphires of th' eternal see,<br />
And by your light illume pure verity.<br />
That azure feldspar hight the microcline,<br />
Or, on its wing, the Menelaus weareth<br />
Such subtlety of shimmering as beareth<br />
This marvel onward through the crystalline,<br />
A splendid calyx that about her gloweth,<br />
Smiting the sunlight on whose ray she goeth.<br />
<br />
IV<br />
<br />
The diver at Sorrento from beneath<br />
The vitreous indigo, who swiftly riseth,<br />
By will and not by action as it seemeth,<br />
Moves not more smoothly, and no thought surmiseth<br />
How she takes motion from the lustrous sheath<br />
Which, as the trace behind the swimmer, gleameth<br />
Yet presseth back the aether where it streameth.<br />
To her whom it adorns this sheath imparteth<br />
The living motion from the light surrounding;<br />
And thus my nobler parts, to grief's confounding,<br />
Impart into my heart a peace which starteth<br />
From one round whom a graciousness is cast<br />
Which clingeth in the air where she hath past.<br />
<br />
V&mdash;TORNATA<br />
<br />
Canzon, to her whose spirit seems in sooth<br />
Akin unto the feldspar, since it is<br />
So clear and subtle and azure, I send thee, saying:<br />
That since I looked upon such potencies<br />
And glories as are here inscribed in truth,<br />
New boldness hath o'erthrown my long delaying,<br />
And that thy words my new-born powers obeying&mdash;<br />
Voices at last to voice my heart's long mood&mdash;<br />
Are come to greet her in their amplitude.<br />

Who are you that the whole world's song<br />
Is shaken out beneath your feet<br />
Leaving you comfortless,<br />

Is garnered, gather in<br />
The blades of man's sin<br />
And bear that sheaf?<br />
Lady of wrong and grief,<br />
Blameless!<br />

Where lips awake our joy<br />
The sad heart sleeps<br />

Dante and I are come to learn of thee,<br />
Ser Guido of Florence, master of us all,<br />
Love, who hath set his hand upon us three,<br />
Bidding us twain upon thy glory call.<br />
Harsh light hath rent from us the golden pall<br />
Of that frail sleep, <i>His</i> first light seigniory,<br />
And we are come through all the modes that fall<br />
Unto their lot who meet him constantly.<br />
Wherefore, by right, in this Lord's name we greet thee,<br />
Seeing we labour at his labour daily.<br />
Thou, who dost know what way swift words are crossed<br />
O thou, who hast sung till none at song defeat thee,<br />
Grant! by thy might and hers of San Michele,<br />
Thy risen voice send flames this pentecost.<br />

From welkin reaching down his glorying hand,<br />
Decks the Great Mother and her changing face,<br />
Clothing her not with scarlet skeins and gold<br />
But with th' empurpling flowers and gay grass,<br />

When, then, I see a lady like the sun,<br />
One fashioned by th' high hand of utmost Jove,<br />
So fair beneath the myrtles on gay grass<br />
Who holdeth Love and Truth, one by each hand,<br />
It seems, if I look straight, two bands of gold<br />
Do make more fair her delicate fair face.<br />

Though eyes are dazzled, looking on her face<br />
As all sight faileth that looks toward the sun,<br />
New metamorphoses, to rained gold,<br />
Or bulls or whitest swans, might fall on Jove<br />
Through her, or Phoebus, his bag-pipes in hand,<br />
Might, mid the droves, come barefoot o'er our grass,<br />

Alas, that there was hidden in the grass<br />
A cruel shaft, the which, to wound my face,<br />

Behold the green shall find itself turned gold<br />
And spring shall be without her flowers and grass,<br />
And hell's deep be the dwelling place of Jove<br />
Ere I shall have uncarved her holy face<br />

"Because my soul cried out, and only the long ways<br />
Grown weary, gave me answer and<br />
Because she answered when the very ways were dumb<br />
With all their hoarse, dry speech grown faint and chill.<br />
Because her answer was a call to me,<br />
Though I have sinned, my God, and though thy angels<br />
Bear no more now my thought to whom I love;<br />
Now though I crouch afraid in all thy dark<br />
Will I once cry to thee:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Once more! Once more my strength!</span><br />
Yea though I sin to call him forth once more,<br />
Thy messengers for mine, Their wings my power!<br />
And let once more my wings fold down above her,<br />
Let their cool length be spread<br />
Over her feet and head<br />
And let thy calm come down<br />
To dwell within her, and thy gown of peace<br />
Clothe all her body in its samite.<br />
O Father of all the blind and all the strong,<br />
Though I have left thy courts, though all the throng<br />
Of thy gold-shimmering choir know me not,<br />
Though I have dared the body and have donned<br />
Its frail strong-seeming, and although<br />
Its lightening joy is made my swifter song,<br />
Though I have known thy stars, yea all, and chosen one.<br />
Yea though I make no barter, and repent no jot,<br />
Yet for the sunlight of that former time<br />
Grant me the boon, O God,<br />
Once more, once more, or I or some white thought<br />
Shall rise beside her and, enveloping<br />
All her strange glory in its wings of light,<br />
Bring down thy peace upon her way-worn soul.<br />
Oh sheathe that sword of her in some strong case,<br />
The doe-skin scabbard of thy clear Rafael!<br />
Yea let thy angels walk, as I have seen<br />
Them passing, or have seen their wings<br />
Spread their pavilions o'er our twin delight.<br />
Yea I have seen them when the purple light<br />
Hid all her garden from my drowsy eyes.<br />

And my heart worked at them unduly.<br />

I say my soul flowed back, became translucent.<br />
Search not my lips, O Love, let go my hands,<br />
This thing that moves as man is no more mortal.<br />
If thou hast seen my shade sans character,<br />
If thou hast seen that mirror of all moments,<br />
That glass to all things that o'ershadow it,<br />
Call not that mirror me, for I have slipped<br />
Your grasp, I have eluded.<br />

How will this beauty, when I am far hence,<br />

I am set wide upon the world's ways<br />

When I behold how black, immortal ink<br />
Drips from my deathless pen&mdash;ah, well-away!<br />
Why should we stop at all for what I think?<br />
There is enough in what I chance to say.<br />
<br />
It is enough that we once came together;<br />
What is the use of setting it to rime?<br />
When it is autumn do we get spring weather,<br />
Or gather may of harsh northwindish time?<br />
<br />
It is enough that we once came together;<br />
What if the wind have turned against the rain?<br />
It is enough that we once came together;<br />
Time has seen this, and will not turn again;<br />
<br />
And who are we, who know that last intent,<br />
To plague to-morrow with a testament!<br />

"Time's bitter flood"! Oh, that's all very well,<br />
But where's the old friend hasn't fallen off,<br />
Or slacked his hand-grip when you first gripped fame?<br />

I know your circle and can fairly tell<br />
What you have kept and what you've left behind:<br />

Golden rose the house, in the portal I saw<br />
thee, a marvel, carven in subtle stuff, a portent.<br />
Life died down in the lamp and flickered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">caught at the wonder.</span><br />
<br />
Crimson, frosty with dew, the roses bend where<br />
thou afar moving in the glamorous sun<br />
drinkst in life of earth, of the air, the tissue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">golden about thee.</span><br />
<br />
Green the ways, the breath of the fields is thine there,<br />
open lies the land, yet the steely going<br />
darkly hast thou dared and the dreaded æther<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">parted before thee.</span><br />
<br />
Swift at courage thou in the shell of gold, casting<br />
a-loose the cloak of the body, camest<br />
straight, then shone thine oriel and the stunned light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">faded about thee.</span><br />
<br />
Half the graven shoulder, the throat aflash with<br />
strands of light inwoven about it, loveliest<br />
of all things, frail alabaster, ah me!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">swift in departing,</span><br />
<br />
Clothed in goldish weft, delicately perfect,<br />
gone as wind! The cloth of the magical hands!<br />
Thou a slight thing, thou in access of cunning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">dar'dst to assume this?</span><br />

"I am thy soul, Nikoptis. I have watched<br />
These five millennia, and thy dead eyes<br />
Moved not, nor ever answer my desire,<br />
And thy light limbs, wherethrough I leapt aflame,<br />
Burn not with me nor any saffron thing.<br />
<br />
See, the light grass sprang up to pillow thee,<br />
And kissed thee with a myriad grassy tongues;<br />
But not thou me.<br />
<br />
I have read out the gold upon the wall,<br />
And wearied out my thought upon the signs.<br />
And there is no new thing in all this place.<br />
<br />
I have been kind. See, I have left the jars sealed,<br />
Lest thou shouldst wake and whimper for thy wine.<br />
And all thy robes I have kept smooth on thee.<br />
<br />
O thou unmindful! How should I forget!<br />
&mdash;Even the river many days ago,<br />
The river, thou wast over young.<br />
And three souls came upon Thee&mdash;<br />
<br />
And I came.<br />
And I flowed in upon thee, beat them off;<br />
I have been intimate with thee, known thy ways.<br />
Have I not touched thy palms and finger-tips,<br />
Flowed in, and through thee and about thy heels?<br />
How 'came I in'? Was I not thee and Thee?<br />
<br />
And no sun comes to rest me in this place,<br />
And I am torn against the jagged dark,<br />
And no light beats upon me, and you say<br />
No word, day after day.<br />
<br />
Oh! I could get me out, despite the marks<br />
And all their crafty work upon the door,<br />
Out through the glass-green fields....<br />

Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea,<br />
London has swept about you this score years<br />
And bright ships left you this or that in fee:<br />
Ideas, old gossip, oddments of all things,<br />
Strange spars of knowledge and dimmed wares of price.<br />
Great minds have sought you&mdash;lacking someone else.<br />
You have been second always. Tragical?<br />
No. You preferred it to the usual thing:<br />
One dull man, dulling and uxorious,<br />
One average mind&mdash;with one thought less, each year.<br />
Oh, you are patient, I have seen you sit<br />
Hours, where something might have floated up.<br />
And now you pay one. Yes, you richly pay.<br />
You are a person of some interest, one comes to you<br />
And takes strange gain away:<br />
Trophies fished up; some curious suggestion;<br />
Fact that leads nowhere; and a tale for two,<br />
Pregnant with mandrakes, or with something else<br />
That might prove useful and yet never proves,<br />
That never fits a corner or shows use,<br />
Or finds its hour upon the loom of days:<br />
The tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work;<br />
Idols and ambergris and rare inlays,<br />
These are your riches, your great store; and yet<br />
For all this sea-hoard of deciduous things,<br />
Strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff:<br />
In the slow float of differing light and deep,<br />
No! there is nothing! In the whole and all,<br />
Nothing that's quite your own.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Yet this is you.</span><br />

Its mind was made up in "the seventies,"<br />

Which brought the hair-cloth chair to such perfection,<br />

<br />
May I for my own self song's truth reckon,<br />
Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days<br />
Hardship endured oft.<br />
Bitter breast-cares have I abided,<br />
Known on my keel many a care's hold,<br />
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent<br />
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head<br />
While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,<br />
My feet were by frost benumbed.<br />
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs<br />
Hew my heart round and hunger begot<br />
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not<br />
That he on dry land loveliest liveth,<br />
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,<br />
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast<br />
Deprived of my kinsmen;<br />
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,<br />
There I heard naught save the harsh sea<br />
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,<br />
Did for my games the gannet's clamour,<br />
Sea-fowls' loudness was for me laughter,<br />
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.<br />
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern<br />
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed<br />
With spray on his pinion.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Not any protector</span><br />
May make merry man faring needy.<br />
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life<br />
Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business,<br />
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft<br />
Must bide above brine.<br />
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,<br />
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then<br />
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now<br />
The heart's thought that I on high streams<br />
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.<br />
Moaneth alway my mind's lust<br />
That I fare forth, that I afar hence<br />
Seek out a foreign fastness.<br />
For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,<br />
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;<br />
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful<br />
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare<br />
Whatever his lord will.<br />
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having<br />
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight<br />
Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,<br />
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.<br />
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,<br />
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,<br />
All this admonisheth man eager of mood,<br />
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks<br />
On flood-ways to be far departing.<br />
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,<br />
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,<br />
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not&mdash;<br />
He the prosperous man&mdash;what some perform<br />
Where wandering them widest draweth.<br />
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,<br />
My mood 'mid the mere-flood,<br />
Over the whale's acre, would wander wide.<br />
On earth's shelter cometh oft to me,<br />
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,<br />
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,<br />
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow<br />
My lord deems to me this dead life<br />
On loan and on land, I believe not<br />
That any earth-weal eternal standeth<br />
Save there be somewhat calamitous<br />
That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.<br />
Disease or oldness or sword-hate<br />
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.<br />
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after&mdash;<br />
Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,<br />
That he will work ere he pass onward,<br />
Frame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice,<br />
Daring ado,...<br />
So that all men shall honour him after<br />
And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,<br />
Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,<br />
Delight mid the doughty.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Days little durable,</span><br />
And all arrogance of earthen riches,<br />
There come now no kings nor Cæsars<br />
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.<br />
Howe'er in mirth most magnified,<br />
Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest,<br />
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!<br />
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.<br />
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.<br />
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.<br />
No man at all going the earth's gait,<br />
But age fares against him, his face paleth,<br />
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,<br />
Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven,<br />
Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,<br />
Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,<br />
Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,<br />
And though he strew the grave with gold,<br />
His born brothers, their buried bodies<br />
Be an unlikely treasure hoard.<br />

Hath of perfect charms so many.<br />
Thoughts of her are of dream's order:<br />
God! that mad'st her well regard her.<br />

<br />
One after one they leave thee,<br />
High Priest of Iacchus,<br />
Intoning thy melodies as winds intone<br />
The whisperings of leaves on sunlit days.<br />
And the sands are many<br />
And the seas beyond the sands are one<br />
In ultimate, so we here being many<br />
Are unity; nathless thy compeers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Knowing thy melody,</span><br />
Lulled with the wine of thy music<br />
Go seaward silently, leaving thee sentinel<br />
O'er all the mysteries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">High Priest of Iacchus.</span><br />
For the lines of life lie under thy fingers,<br />
And above the vari-coloured strands<br />
Thine eyes look out unto the infinitude<br />
Of the blue waves of heaven,<br />
And even as Triplex Sisterhood<br />
Thou fingerest the threads knowing neither<br />
Cause nor the ending,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">High Priest of Iacchus,</span><br />
Draw'st forth a multiplicity<br />
Of strands, and, beholding<br />
The colour thereof, raisest thy voice<br />
Towards the sunset,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O High Priest of Iacchus!</span><br />
And out of the secrets of the inmost mysteries<br />
Thou chantest strange far-sourced canticles:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O High Priest of Iacchus!</span><br />
Life and the ways of Death her<br />
Twin-born sister, that is life's counterpart,<br />
And of night and the winds of night;<br />
Silent voices ministering to the souls<br />
Of hamadryads that hold council concealèd<br />
In streams and tree-shadowing<br />
Forests on hill slopes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O High Priest of Iacchus,</span><br />
All the manifold mystery<br />
Thou makest a wine of song,<br />
And maddest thy following even<br />
With visions of great deeds<br />
And their futility,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O High Priest of Iacchus!</span><br />
Though thy co-novices are bent to the scythe<br />
Of the magian wind that is voice of Persephone,<br />
Leaving thee solitary, master of initiating<br />
Mænads that come through the<br />
Vine-entangled ways of the forest<br />
Seeking, out of all the world,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Madness of Iacchus,</span><br />
That being skilled in the secrets of the double cup<br />
They might turn the dead of the world<br />
Into pæans,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O High Priest of Iacchus,</span><br />
Wreathed with the glory of thy years of creating<br />
Entangled music,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Breathe!</span><br />
Now that the evening cometh upon thee,<br />
Breathe upon us, that low-bowed and exultant<br />
Drink wine of Iacchus, that since the conquering<br />
Hath been chiefly containèd in the numbers<br />
Of them that, even as thou, have woven<br />
Wicker baskets for grape clusters<br />
Wherein is concealèd the source of the vintage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O High Priest of Iacchus,</span><br />
Breathe thou upon us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Thy magic in parting!</span><br />
Even as they thy co-novices,<br />
At being mingled with the sea,<br />
While yet thou madest thy canticles<br />
Serving upright before the altar<br />
That is bound about with shadows<br />
Of dead years wherein thy Iacchus<br />
Looked not upon the hills, that being<br />
Uncared for, praised not him in entirety.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O High Priest of Iacchus,</span><br />
Being now near to the border of the sands<br />
Where the sapphire girdle of the sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Encinctureth the maiden</span><br />
Persephone, released for the spring,<br />
Look! Breathe upon us<br />
The wonder of the thrice encinctured mystery<br />
Whereby thou being full of years art young,<br />
Loving even this lithe Persephone<br />
That is free for the seasons of plenty;<br />
Whereby thou being young art old<br />
And shalt stand before this Persephone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whom thou lovest,</span><br />
In darkness, even at that time<br />
That she being returned to her husband<br />
Shall be queen and a maiden no longer,<br />
Wherein thou being neither old nor young<br />
Standing on the verge of the sea<br />
Shalt pass from being sand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O High Priest of Iacchus,</span><br />
And becoming wave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shalt encircle all sands,</span><br />
Being transmuted through all<br />
The girdling of the sea.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O High Priest of Iacchus,</span><br />
Breathe thou upon us!<br />

No, no! Go from me. I have still the flavour,<br />
Soft as spring wind that's come from birchen bowers.<br />

<h3>THE COMPLETE POETICAL WORKS OF T.E. HULME</h3>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<h4><a name="PREFATORY_NOTE" id="PREFATORY_NOTE"></a>PREFATORY NOTE</h4>


<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;">
In publishing his <i>Complete Poetical Works</i>
at thirty,<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mr Hulme has set an enviable
example to many of his contemporarieswho have had less to say.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;">They are reprinted here for good
fellowship; for good custom, a custom
out of Tuscany and of Provence; and
thirdly, for convenience, seeing their smallness
of bulk; and for good memory,
seeing that they recall certain evenings
and meetings of two years gone, dull
enough at the time, but rather pleasant
to look back upon.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;">As for the "School of Images," which
may or may not have existed, its principles
were not so interesting as those of the
"inherent dynamists" or of <i>Les Unanimistes</i>,
yet they were probably sounder
than those of a certain French school
which attempted to dispense with verbs
altogether; or of the Impressionists who
brought forth:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;">
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"Pink pigs blossoming upon the hillside";</span><br />
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;">or of the Post-Impressionists who beseech
their ladies to let down slate-blue hair
over their raspberry-coloured flanks.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><i>Ardoise</i> rimed richly&mdash;ah, richly and rarely
rimed!&mdash;with <i>framboise</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;">As for the future, <i>Les Imagistes</i>, the
descendants of the forgotten school of
1909, have that in their keeping.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;">I refrain from publishing my proposed
<i>Historical Memoir</i> of their forerunners,
because Mr Hulme has threatened to
print the original propaganda.</p>

I walked abroad,<br />

Motionless and faint of breath<br />
By loveliness that is her own eunuch.<br />

Now pass I to the final river<br />
Ignominiously, in a sack, without sound,<br />
As any peeping Turk to the Bosphorus.<br />
